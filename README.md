# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This project demonstrates the concepts learnt in the Getting and Cleaning Data course. The run_analysis.R script does the
following:

1.) Downloads the given zip file into the working directory.<br>
2.) Extracts the zip file into the working directory.<br>
3.) Loads training data,test data, features and activity labels into R.<br>
4.) Assigns appropriate column names to training data, test data and activity labels.<br>
5.) Merges training data and test data together.<br>
6.) Extracts measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br>
7.) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.<br>
8.) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.<br>
9.) Writes the final dataset to the working directory.<br>

The file containing the tidy data set is tidydataset.txt.
