# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This project demonstrates the concepts learnt in the Getting and Cleaning Data course. The run_analysis.R script does the
following:

1.) Downloads the given zip file into the working directory.
2.) Extracts the zip file into the working directory.
3.) Loads training data,test data, features and activity labels into R.
4.) Assigns appropriate column names to training data, test data and activity labels.
5.) Merges training data and test data together
6.) Extracts measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
7.) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
8.) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
9.) Writes the final dataset to the working directory

The file containing the tidy data set is tidydataset.txt.
